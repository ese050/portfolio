# DevOps Terraform Project

This repository serves as my DevOps Terraform Project, showcasing my skills and experience in developing highly available and scalable web application infrastructures on AWS using Terraform.

## Project Overview

The main goal of this project is to provision a robust web application infrastructure on AWS, leveraging various AWS services such as VPC, EC2 instances, Elastic Load Balancer, Auto Scaling, and RDS database. The infrastructure ensures high availability and scalability to handle increased traffic and workload.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- **main.tf**: The main Terraform configuration file defining the AWS provider and infrastructure resources.
- **modules/**: Directory containing reusable Terraform modules for provisioning specific components of the infrastructure.
- **variables.tf**: File defining input variables used in the Terraform configuration.
- **outputs.tf**: File defining the outputs of the Terraform configuration.

## Getting Started

To use this project and deploy the web application infrastructure, follow these steps:

1. Install Terraform by visiting the official website (link to Terraform installation guide).
2. Set up AWS credentials on your local machine using the AWS CLI.
3. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone <repository-url>`.
4. Navigate to the project directory: `cd devops-resume-portfolio`.
5. Open the `main.tf` file and customize the configuration to fit your requirements (e.g., region, CIDR blocks, availability zones).
6. Run `terraform init` to initialize the project and download the necessary providers.
7. Run `terraform plan` to preview the resources that will be created.
8. Run `terraform apply` to provision the infrastructure on AWS.
9. Wait for the Terraform deployment to complete and observe the output for the infrastructure details.
10. Access your web application using the provided URL.
